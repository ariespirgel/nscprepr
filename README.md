# nscprepr

This package contains one function - `nsc_prep()` - which prepares and writes a file that is ready for submission to the National Student Clearinghouse's StudentTracker service. 

Begin by installing the package from CRAN and loading it:

```r
install.packages("nscprepr") # first time only
library(nscprepr)

```

Then, store a data frame containing (at minimum) the columns in the example below. The column names must be included (in any order) *exactly* as they are named in the example data frame (case sensitive)<sup>1</sup>. Notice that it is OK to violate some Clearinghouse requirements in your data frame, as `nsc_prep()` will resolve the issues (e.g., single digit days can be one (e.g., `3`) or two (e.g., `03`) digits, you can include full middle names as opposed to just the required single characters for the middle initial).

```r
df <- data.frame(first = c("Ruth", "William", "Sandra"),
             middle = c("Bader", "J.", "D"),
             last = c("Ginsburg", "Brennan", "O'Connor"),
             suffix = c("", "Jr.", ""),
             dob = c("3/15/1933", "5/25/1906", "03/26/1930"),
             id = c(1, 2, 3),
             search_date = c("1/1/1952", "6/01/1930", "8/5/1971"))
```


Lastly, include your data frame in the `nsc_prep()` function along with your inquiry type and  school's information<sup>1</sup>. A file will be saved to your working directory that is completely formatted and ready for submission to the National Student Clearinghouse's StudentTracker service (e.g., it will not include the column names that are printed in the data frame below).

```r
# substitute your institution's information
nsc_prep(data = df, institution_code = "001509", branch_code = "00",
                institution_name = "Nova Southeastern University",
                inquiry_type = "SE")

## # ... with 6 more variables: dob <chr>, search_date <chr>, blank_1 <chr>,
